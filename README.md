# physxframework
A wrapper DLL for doing simple PhysX simulations

This DLL provides a simple wrapper for the PhysX DLL to
create simple demos and test applications; without
requiring the entire PhysX SDK header files and libraries
which have licensing restrictions.

It also provides bindings to the NvRenderDebug remote
visualization library and, of course PVD as well.
